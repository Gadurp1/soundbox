# The audio.cpp runtime is not built here. The final stage starts FROM
# audio.cpp's own published image (ghcr.io/0xshug0/audio.cpp), which already
# carries `audiocpp_cli`, its ggml backend libraries, ffmpeg and the matching
# CUDA/Vulkan runtime, for amd64 and arm64. Soundbox adds Node and itself on
# top. That keeps the GPU variants a build-arg rather than a second toolchain:
# upstream's Linux release tarballs ship no CUDA `audiocpp_cli` at all, and
# compiling ggml's CUDA kernels in this build would take the better part of an
# hour.
#
# See docs/INSTALL.md#docker for volumes, GPUs and SOUNDBOX_ALLOWED_HOSTS.

# Which upstream audio.cpp image to build on: full-cpu, full-cuda12,
# full-cuda13 or full-vulkan. Those tags move daily; pin a dated one
# (full-cuda12-20261013-f1c299b) for a reproducible build.
