/**
 * Where the marketing pages' CTAs point.
 *
 * These pages — the landing page, `/sfx`, `/music` and the model write-ups —
 * used to be built twice: once inside the app, where "open the generator"
 * could be an in-app route, and once on the public static site, where there is
 * no generator to open. Every constant here was a ternary on that difference.
 *
 * They now live *only* in `site/` (see `site/src/routes.tsx`; the app's router
 * has no marketing tier at all), so there is one answer per link rather than
 * two. What remains is the split that was always real: some of these
 * destinations are pages on the site, and some are off-site, because the thing
 * they point at is a piece of software you install rather than a page you can
 * visit.

 * The fallback is the canonical repo, so a build with no env set still
 * produces working links rather than `undefined/blob/main/...`. Vite inlines
 * this at build time and only exposes `VITE_`-prefixed vars, so the name has
 * to keep that prefix to reach the browser at all.
