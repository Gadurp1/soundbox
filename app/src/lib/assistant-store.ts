/**
 * The studio assistant's threads — one per conversation, not one in total.
 *
 * A store rather than component state for the same reason the Generate
 * session is one: the conversation is the work. Building a prompt takes a few
 * turns, and bouncing to Models to check a licence — or to the studio to
 * load what was proposed — unmounts the page. Losing the thread to that
 * round trip would make the assistant a thing you use once, carefully.
 *
 * It used to be a single `messages` array, which meant every studio showed
 * the same conversation: open one story, ask for a bassline, open another,
 * and the thread beside the second timeline was talking about the first.
 * Worse, the edits card under a turn describes a plan written against *that*
 * story's tracks, so a shared thread offered Apply buttons for an arrangement
 * that was no longer on screen. Threads are keyed now — a studio passes its
 * story id, the Chat page uses {@link DEFAULT_THREAD} — and the assistant
 * beside a timeline is the conversation about that timeline.
 *
 * Threads persist, because "what did I ask it to do here" is a question you
 * have on the second visit rather than the first. What does not persist is
 * `pending`: a reload during a request would otherwise come back with the
 * input locked against an answer that is never arriving.
 *
 * Nothing here talks to the server. The page sends the thread and folds the
 * reply back in, so the store is only ever a record of what was said and
 * what came of it.
