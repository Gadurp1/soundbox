/**
 * The take, as one document two panels share.
 *
 * The MIDI panel is a performance surface — press keys, notes arrive — and the
 * piano roll is an editing surface for the same notes. If each owned its own
 * list, playing a phrase and then fixing the one note you fluffed would mean
 * copying it between panels, which is not a workflow anyone would choose.
 *
 * So the notes, the instrument that renders them, and what to ask a model for
 * afterwards all live here, and both panels are views of it. Neither is
 * required: closing the roll leaves the recorder working, and vice versa.
 *
 * Not persisted. A take becomes a clip on the timeline the moment it is worth
 * keeping, and that clip is what the story stores — see `midi-panel.tsx` for
 * why the story keeps audio rather than notes.
