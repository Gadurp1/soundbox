/**
 * Icons for separated stems, drawn rather than generated.
 *
 * A stem's instrument is a closed set — htdemucs emits vocals/drums/bass/other,
 * and the wider audio.cpp separators add guitar and piano — so this is a lookup,
 * not a generation. Three reasons it stays that way, all of which the image
 * model loses on:
 *
 *   - It works with artwork turned off, which is the default. A stem list that
 *     only had icons for users who downloaded a diffusion model would be a
 *     stem list nobody sees icons in.
 *   - It is identical every time. Two renders of "drums" from a diffusion model
 *     are two different drum kits, and a list where the same stem type looks
 *     different per row reads as noise.
 *   - It costs nothing. These are inline SVG paths; the alternative is seconds
 *     of GPU time and a megabyte on disk per stem.
 *
 * Everything here is stroke-based and inherits `currentColor`, so it themes
 * with the rest of the UI instead of carrying baked-in light-mode pixels.
