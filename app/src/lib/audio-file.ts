 * taught m4a without a new dependency the user would have to install. The
 * browser already ships a decoder for every format it can play (m4a/aac, mp3,
 * ogg, opus, flac, and the webm the recorder produces), so the conversion
 * happens here instead: decode with Web Audio, re-encode as PCM, upload that.
 *
 * WAV files are passed through untouched rather than round-tripped, so a
 * 24-bit or float clip keeps its depth instead of being quietly flattened to
 * 16-bit on its way in.
