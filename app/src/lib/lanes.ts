/**
 * A colour per track.
 *
 * Once a timeline has five lanes of near-identical grey waveforms, "which one
 * was the drums" costs a read of the gutter every time. A hue per lane makes
 * that a glance, and it has to be the *same* hue everywhere the lane appears —
 * the clip, the track header, the device rack's lane buttons — or it is
 * decoration rather than identity.
 *
 * Hues rather than a palette of finished colours: lightness and chroma come
 * from `--lane-l` and `--lane-c` in `index.css`, which the light and dark
 * themes each set for themselves. So one hue number produces a colour that is
 * legible on white and on near-black without this file knowing which is on.
 *
 * Eight of them, evenly spaced across the arc that is left once the teal
 * accent's neighbourhood (hue 195, give or take) is excluded — a lane the
 * colour of the accent reads as "selected". The order then steps half way
 * round the ramp each time rather than walking it, so lanes 0 and 1 are
 * opposites instead of neighbours; adjacent tracks are what you most need to
 * tell apart.
 *
 * Lanes past the eighth repeat, which is a real limit: a story with nine
 * tracks has two lanes the same colour, and that is still better than nine
 * that all match.
