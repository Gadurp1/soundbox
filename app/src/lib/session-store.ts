/**
 * The Generate conversation.
 *
 * The durable record is the server: every generation belongs to a session
 * (see /api/sessions), and a session can be reopened from the sidebar's
 * Recent list. This store is the *live view* of one of them — the turns on
 * screen, plus whatever is still in flight — and `sessionId` is what ties
 * the two together: it rides on every GenerateRequest so the server groups
 * new sounds into the same thread, and it is what a Recent click sets before
 * pulling that session's sounds down and rebuilding the turns from them.
 *
 * It is a store rather than component state for one reason: bouncing to the
 * Library and back unmounts the page, and losing your thread of refinements to
 * a round trip through another screen would be maddening. An in-flight job
 * survives that too — both the real SSE endpoint and the mock emit the job's
 * current state to a late subscriber, so the stream simply picks back up.
