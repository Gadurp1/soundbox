/**
 * What the knobs, pads and pedal do.
 *
 * A 25-key controller is mostly not keys. It is four knobs, eight pads, a
 * couple of wheels, a pedal jack and a transport row, and until now every one
 * of those arrived at the panel and was thrown away — which is what made a
 * connected board feel like a broken one. This module is the layer that turns
 * "CC 74 on channel 1" into "cover strength".
 *
 * Two things make it tolerable to live with:
 *
 * - **Learn beats guessing.** Every target can be bound by wiggling the
 *   control you want, because no table of factory CC numbers survives contact
 *   with a controller whose knobs are re-assignable in its own editor app.
 *   The presets below are a starting point, not a claim.
 * - **The map is the user's, not the take's.** It is about the hardware on the
 *   desk, so it persists in `localStorage` and outlives every story, rather
 *   than living in the store next to the notes.
 *
 * Bindings are matched, not indexed: one control can drive one target, but
 * finding which is a scan over at most a dozen entries per message, and that
 * is cheaper than keeping a reverse index correct through Learn.
