/**
 * Notes, and how they become audio.
 *
 * MIDI in the studio (experimental) answers one question: can a performance
 * played on a keyboard be turned into a violin in a large hall? Nothing in the model
 * catalogue takes notes as input — audio.cpp's models take text, or text plus
 * a source clip — so the answer is a two-stage flow, and this file is the
 * first stage:
 *
 *     notes ──▶ [synth, here] ──▶ neutral WAV ──▶ [ACE-Step cover] ──▶ violin
 *
 * The first arrow is deliberately *not* a model. Pitch and timing have to be
 * exactly right — that is the whole value the MIDI adds — and a generative
 * model asked to invent both is a model that will get one of them wrong. So
 * the notes are rendered by a plain synth, and the model is only ever asked
 * for timbre, over audio whose notes are already correct.
 *
 * Which is also why the presets below are bright and harmonically rich rather
 * than pretty. A cover pass conditions on what it is given: a sine wave hands
 * it almost no spectral detail to work from, a sawtooth through a filter hands
 * it a full harmonic series with an envelope. The dry render is not meant to
 * be listened to — it is meant to be conditioned on.
 *
 * No sample assets. A bundled SoundFont would render more convincingly on its
 * own, but it is tens of megabytes in the app for a stage whose output is
 * about to be replaced, and licensing a sample set is a bigger question than
 * this feature.
