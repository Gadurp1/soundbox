/**
 * One global "who is playing" store. Every waveform player watches `playingId`
 * and pauses itself the moment another sound takes over, so only one sound is
 * ever audible.
 *
 * `sound` is a second, coarser piece of state: the sound bound to the fixed
 * player at the bottom of the app (`NowPlayingBar`). Setting it is how a
 * Library row says "play this and keep it visible while I scroll away" — the
 * bar is a distinct player instance from whatever inline waveform triggered
 * it, so it needs the whole `Sound`, not just an id, to render on its own.
