/**
 * Dragging a sound out of the library and onto the timeline.
 *
 * A custom MIME type rather than `text/plain`, so a lane can tell "a sound
 * from this app" apart from any old text a browser will happily let you drop
 * on a page — the lane checks `dataTransfer.types` during dragover, and
 * anything else is refused before the pointer ever suggests it would land.
 *
 * `text/plain` carries the sound's name, both as a courtesy to other drop
 * targets and because the timeline labels the clip it creates with it.
 *
 * The rest of what a drop needs to know — how long the sound is, so it can
 * tell whether it fits where it landed — is kept here in a module variable
 * rather than in the drag payload. `DataTransfer` withholds its data until the
 * drop itself, so a lane cannot read it while deciding what the drop *would*
 * do; and this only has to survive a drag inside one page, which shares this
 * module with the library pane that started it.
