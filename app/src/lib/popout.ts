 * it is the same component tree, the same stores, the same audio graph and the
 * same query cache as the studio it came from. Edit a clip in a timeline on
 * your second monitor and the script beside the main window moves with it,
 * because there is only one of each.
 *
 * The cost is that the window can only be opened from a gesture (browsers
 * block `window.open` otherwise), so a pop-out never survives a reload: the
 * panel comes back into the studio and you drag it out again.
