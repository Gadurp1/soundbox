/**
 * Content model for the `/models` pages — the public write-up of every model
 * Soundbox can run.
 *
 * ## Why this file was rewritten
 *
 * The previous version described five models (MOSS-SoundEffect, AudioLDM 2,
 * Stable Audio Open, TangoFlux, AudioGen) sourced, per its own docstring,
 * from `backend/src/soundbox/models/*.py` — a Python backend that no longer
 * exists in this repo. None of those five are in the shipped catalog. Its
 * `install.command` field held `uv sync --extra ...` lines for virtualenvs
 * and torch pins that apply to nothing any more.
 *
 * The source of truth today is `server/src/models/audiocpp_models_catalog.json`
 * plus `docs/AUDIOCPP.md`. Every model runs through one native binary,
 * audio.cpp, so there is no per-model install command to document — which is
 * why `install` is gone from this schema entirely and replaced by `weights`.
 *
 * ## The rule this schema exists to enforce
 *
 * Every licence claim carries a source link, and "we could not confirm this"
 * is a first-class value rather than something to paper over with a
 * permissive default. That is why `commercial` has an `"unknown"` member that
 * the app's own `LicenseInfo` (see `@/lib/api`) does not, and why
 * `LicenseFinding.sources` is required and non-empty by convention.
 * `docs/AUDIOCPP.md` takes the same line for custom entries: omitting
 * `license` shows the model as "Unspecified / not commercial", because "a
 * wrong permissive default is worse than an honest unknown".
 *
 * These pages are prerendered by vite-react-ssg with no server behind them.
 * Everything here is static data, written once per model; the templates in
 * `routes/models-hub.tsx` and `routes/models-detail.tsx` decide how to show
 * it.
