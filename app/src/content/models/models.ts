/**
 * Every model Soundbox can run, written up for `/models`.
 *
 * ## Where these facts come from
 *
 * - **Specs** (family, sample rate, channels, max duration, VRAM, weights
 *   globs, listed-vs-opt-in, verified) are transcribed from
 *   `server/src/models/audiocpp_models_catalog.json`. That file is the
 *   shipped catalog and the app's source of truth; a number here that
 *   disagrees with it is a bug in this file.
 * - **How the engine works** is from `docs/AUDIOCPP.md` and audio.cpp's own
 *   README (https://github.com/0xShug0/audio.cpp), read 2026-08-25.
 * - **Licences** were researched model by model on 2026-08-25 against
 *   upstream licence files, Hugging Face model cards and HF API metadata.
 *   Every finding carries the links it came from. Two secondary sources
 *   recur and are worth naming once:
 *   - the conversion table on
 *     https://huggingface.co/audio-cpp/audio.cpp-gguf, which lists an
 *     "Original model license" per GGUF package. It is the converter's
 *     label, not the rights-holder's, and where it disagrees with upstream
 *     we say so in `correction` and follow **upstream**, restrictively.
 *   - that repo's own terms: "Use and redistribution are governed by the
 *     corresponding original model license listed above."
 *
 * ## The rewrite
 *
 * This file previously described MOSS-SoundEffect v2.0, AudioLDM 2, Stable
 * Audio Open, TangoFlux and AudioGen, sourced from a Python backend
 * (`backend/src/soundbox/models/*.py`) that no longer exists, with
 * `uv pip install` instructions for virtualenvs and torch pins that apply to
 * nothing. None of those five models are in the catalog. Everything below is
 * a rebuild against what actually ships.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * No licence claim without a link, and no guessing. Where a licence could not
 * be confirmed the entry says `commercial: "unknown"` and the page prints
 * "we could not confirm" — see `types.ts` for why that state exists, and
 * `docs/AUDIOCPP.md`'s note that omitting a licence means "Unspecified / not
 * commercial", because a wrong permissive default is worse than an honest
 * unknown.
