/**
 * Content model for the `/music` landing page.
 *
 * Same rule as `content/sfx/types.ts`: this is a *content* schema, not a UI
 * schema. Everything here is written once per track and the template decides
 * how to render it, so adding a track never means touching a component.
 *
 * Two things deliberately absent:
 *
 * - **Audio metadata.** Duration, sample rate and the 256 waveform peaks live
 *   beside the MP3s in `site/public/music/manifest.json` (see
 *   `scripts/gen-music-tracks.mjs`). Twelve tracks' worth of peaks is ~20 KB
 *   of numbers; bundling it would dominate the page's JS for data the player
 *   only needs once it renders.
 * - **Any notion of an "album" or an "artist".** The reference layout this
 *   page is modelled on is a streaming dashboard, and it would have been easy
 *   to borrow its vocabulary wholesale. These are single renders from a named
 *   local model, so the subtitle line under each cover is the model that made
 *   it, not a fictional band. A page whose argument is "you can verify every
 *   claim on it" cannot open with an invented discography.
