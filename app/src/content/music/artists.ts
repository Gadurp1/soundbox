/**
 * Soundbox Records — the mock label on `/music`, and its twenty-act roster.
 *
 * The rest of the page is strict about invention (every track credits the
 * model that rendered it), so a label of fictional artists only works if it
 * is labelled fictional and earns its place by teaching something real. It
 * does: each act is a **prompt persona** — a house-style string held constant
 * across renders, which is all a band identity is to a generative model —
 * and each act has a real signature track rendered from exactly that string,
 * so the roster is audible, not decorative.
 *
 * The signature-track audio lives beside the covers in
 * `site/public/music/artists/` (`<slug>.mp3` + `manifest.json`), produced by
 * `scripts/gen-artist-tracks.mjs` — whose prompts must stay in sync with the
 * `signaturePrompt` fields here, same contract as tracks.ts has with its
 * render script. Covers are local Stable Diffusion 3.5 renders
 * (scripts/gen_sd35.py + scripts/gen-artist-covers.json): abstract art, no
 * text, no logos, no people, so no card can pass for a real release.
 *
 * Names are invented compounds checked against real acts; if one collides
 * anyway, rename it here — nothing else references them.
