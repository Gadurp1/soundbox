/**
 * Content model for the MCP tool surface: one entry per tool an agent sees
 * once it connects, grouped the way a person meets them.
 *
 * Derived from `server/src/mcp/server.ts` — its exported `MCP_TOOLS` table for
 * names and titles, and the zod `inputSchema` on each `registerTool` call for
 * argument names, types and required-ness. **The server is ground truth.** If
 * this file and that one disagree, this file is wrong.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. This documentation described five tools long after
 * the server had grown to twenty, and cited `backend/src/soundbox/mcp_server.py`
 * — a Python module that no longer exists. Anyone reading it concluded Soundbox
 * could generate sounds and nothing else: no speech, no stories, no timeline.
 * The whole voice and arrangement half of the product was invisible. Hence the
 * split into a content module: the reference page and the marketing page now
 * read the same list, so a tool can only go missing from both at once.
 *
 * `blurb` is written for a reader deciding whether to reach for a tool, not
 * copied from the server's `description` — that one is written for the model
 * choosing at call time and is longer and more cautionary than a docs page
 * wants. `args` is a chosen subset: the arguments a caller actually has to
 * think about, not every optional field.
