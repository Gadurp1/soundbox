/**
 * Content model for the programmatic SEO sound-effect pages (`/sfx/*`).
 *
 * These types are deliberately a *content* schema, not a UI schema: every field
 * is something a human (or a scripted pass reviewed by a human) writes once per
 * category, and the page template decides how to render it. Adding a category
 * must never mean touching a component.
 *
 * The audio itself is not in here. Waveform peaks are ~10 KB of numbers per
 * category and would dominate the JS bundle; they live beside the MP3s in
 * `site/public/sfx/<slug>/manifest.json` and are fetched by the sample grid. See
 * scripts/gen-sfx-samples.ts for the render script that produces both.

 * carry that model's id and licence consequences. `"placeholder"` samples are
 * stand-ins used while a category is being built out — the template labels them
 * as such, and a category with any placeholder left in it is not publishable.
