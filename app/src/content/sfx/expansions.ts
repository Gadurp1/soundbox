/**
 * Additional samples appended to the categories written in `categories.ts`.
 *
 * Why a separate file rather than more entries inline: `categories.ts` is
 * already thousands of lines of prose, and the sample grids are the part that
 * grows fastest. Keeping the prose and the render queue apart means a pass that
 * only adds clips produces a diff you can actually read.
 *
 * What's in here is not filler. Every entry answers a search term that appears
 * on the featured or popular shelf of at least one of the big libraries —
 * Epidemic Sound's category tree, ElevenLabs' sound-effect directory, Pixabay's
 * popular tags, Mixkit's front page — checked against what these collections
 * were already missing. The bias is deliberately toward the specific: nobody
 * searches "impact", they search "glass break", "body fall", "punch".
 *
 * `durationS` is the render length and matters more than it looks. A UI tick
 * asked to fill four seconds comes back with three and a half seconds of the
 * model inventing room tone, and an ambience bed asked for two seconds comes
 * back unusable. Set it to the length the sound actually is.
