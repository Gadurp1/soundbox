        body: "A servo motor whirring dry and close sounds small, like part of a robot arm or a printer. The same whir with factory room tone and more low end sounds industrial. Machinery prompts range from a wristwatch mechanism to a hydraulic press, and naming the room (\"close mic\" and dry for small devices, \"factory room tone\" for large equipment) often sets the scale better than a size adjective.",

        question: "Can I use these sounds in a commercial video or game?",
        answer: "It depends on the model that made them. Soundbox shows each model's licence before you download its weights. The Stable Audio 3 models use the Stability AI Community License: commercial use is free below USD $1M annual revenue, and above that Stability requires an enterprise licence. ACE-Step 1.5 is MIT. MiniMax's models allow commercial use under a revenue cap and require an attribution notice. Some voice and stem-separation models are non-commercial only. Soundbox itself is MIT, but the audio is governed by the licence of the model that made it. Read that licence before you ship; this summary is not legal advice.",
      },
      {
        question: "Does this run offline?",
        answer: "Yes, once the weights are downloaded. Soundbox runs the models locally and stores everything in one SQLite file and one folder of WAVs under ~/.soundbox. There is no account, API key or upload step. Only the initial model download needs the network.",
      },
      {
        question: "What hardware do I need?",
        answer: "An NVIDIA GPU with 8 GB or more. CPU-only is supported, but each generation then takes minutes. That is fine for a few short clips and slow for a large batch.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can my coding agent generate these for me?",
        answer: "Yes. While Soundbox is running it serves MCP at http://127.0.0.1:17494/mcp, with tools for generating and listing sounds. An agent can generate a sound as part of the task it is already doing and gets back an absolute file path to use in your project.",
      },
      {
        question: "How is this different from downloading a sample pack?",
        answer: "A pack gives you one factory's conveyor belt, recorded at whatever distance and load the recordist captured. Generating gives you a machine sound at the scale and room your scene needs, and a matched startup, run and power-down from the same prompt family. It costs time and a GPU.",
