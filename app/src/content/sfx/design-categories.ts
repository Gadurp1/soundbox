        "It depends on the model that made them. Soundbox shows each model's licence before you download its weights. The clips on this page were rendered with Stable Audio 3.0 Small SFX, which uses the Stability AI Community License: commercial use is free below USD $1M annual revenue, and above that Stability requires an enterprise licence.

      answer:
        "Yes, once the weights are on disk. Generation, the library and the HTTP API all run locally against one SQLite file and one folder of WAVs under ~/.soundbox. There is no account and no API key, and nothing is uploaded. The only step that uses the network is the initial model download.",

CPU-only generation is supported, but expect minutes per clip instead of seconds: fine for a handful of sounds, slow for a whole library.",

Every generated file comes back as an absolute path, so a coding agent can render the sound a scene needs and put it straight into the project.
