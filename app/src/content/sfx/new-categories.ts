/**
 * Collections added after auditing what the big libraries actually shelve.
 *
 * The original taxonomy in `categories.ts` was built around game and film
 * search terms, which covered the loudest half of the demand and missed the
 * half that professional libraries are mostly made of. Epidemic Sound's tree
 * devotes a whole branch to materials — glass, metal, wood, paper, cloth — and
 * ElevenLabs' directory lists them individually too, because that is how a
 * sound editor thinks: not "impact" but "which material hit which material".
 * The same audit turned up vehicles, human effort, and the trailer-design
 * family (riser, braam, drone) that Soundsnap puts on its own front page.
 *
 * Every category here is a real page with its own craft notes, not a slug with
 * a template behind it. The rule from `categories.ts` still holds: if nobody
 * wrote it, it does not ship.
 *
 * Structurally these are identical to the originals — same `SfxCategory` — and
 * they are concatenated onto the same exported list. They live apart only so
 * the diff that introduced two dozen collections is reviewable.

        "It depends on the model that made them. Soundbox shows each model's licence before you download its weights. The clips on this page were rendered with Stable Audio 3.0 Small SFX, which uses the Stability AI Community License: commercial use is free below USD $1M annual revenue, and above that Stability requires an enterprise licence. Soundbox itself is MIT, but the audio is governed by the licence of the model that made it. Read that licence before you ship; this summary is not legal advice.",

      question: "Does this work offline?",
      answer:
        "Yes, once the weights are on disk. Generation, the library and the HTTP API all run locally against one SQLite file and one folder of WAVs under ~/.soundbox. There is no account and no API key, and nothing is uploaded. The only step that uses the network is the initial model download.",

      question: "What hardware does it need?",
      answer:
        "The clips here were rendered on a consumer NVIDIA GPU at roughly ten seconds of wall time per clip, through audio.cpp's quantised GGUF runtime, which needs little VRAM. CPU-only generation is supported, but expect minutes per clip instead of seconds: fine for a handful of sounds, slow for a whole library.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can an agent generate these for me?",
      answer:
        "Yes. While the app is open, Soundbox runs an MCP server at http://127.0.0.1:17494/mcp with tools for generating, listing and mixing sounds. Every generated file comes back as an absolute path, so a coding agent can render the sound a scene needs and put it straight into the project.
