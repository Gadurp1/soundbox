/**
 * Watch one story change under you.
 *
 * A story is not single-player: an agent can be writing lines over MCP while
 * the studio is open on the same timeline. Without this the page silently
 * drifts out of date and you end up editing a script that no longer matches
 * what you are looking at.
 *
 * Two things arrive. `changed` means refetch — the queries are invalidated and
 * react-query does the rest, so the script and timeline update in place rather
 * than the page reloading. `agent` means a tool is mid-work, which the studio
 * uses to say so and to stop taking edits that would race it.
