/**
 * Undo/redo for timeline edits.
 *
 * Inverse operations rather than snapshots: the story lives on the server, so
 * "restore the previous state" would mean diffing and replaying whole
 * collections. Every edit already knows how to undo itself — a move knows
 * where the clip was, a delete knows what it deleted — so each one contributes
 * its own inverse and this only has to remember the order.
 *
 * Scoped to the page, not persisted. Undo is about the last few minutes of
 * work; an undo stack that survived a reload would offer to reverse edits
 * whose context is long gone, and would have to reason about everything an
 * agent changed in between.
