/**
 * Record a clip from the user's microphone.
 *
 * Wraps MediaRecorder rather than exposing it, because the teardown has an
 * ordering constraint that is easy to get wrong and fails silently when you
 * do: `MediaRecorder.stop()` is asynchronous — it queues the final
 * `dataavailable` and only then `stop` — so the microphone track must not be
 * stopped until `onstop` has run. Killing the track in the same tick as
 * `stop()` ends the stream before the encoder flushes, and the take comes back
 * truncated or empty with no error anywhere. `stop()` therefore only stops the
 * recorder; `release()` (the hard teardown, for unmount) is the only thing that
 * touches tracks directly.
 *
 * The output container is whatever the browser chose — webm/opus on Chrome and
 * Firefox, mp4/aac on Safari. Callers are not expected to care: `toWav()` in
 * lib/audio-file.ts decodes all of them.
