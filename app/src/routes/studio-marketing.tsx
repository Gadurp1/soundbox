/**
 * Studio — the page that sells the timeline, prerendered at `/studio`.
 *
 * These four sections all used to sit on the landing page, one after another.
 * That was four consecutive sticky scroll-stages between the hero and the
 * first word about models, which made the front door a studio tour with a
 * generator bolted to the top of it. The generator is what someone arrives
 * for; the studio is what they stay for, and those are two different pitches
 * that were fighting for the same screens.
 *
 * So the studio pitch moved here whole. Nothing was rewritten in the move —
 * `RevealEditRoutes`, `RevealStudio`, `RevealAgenticChat` and
 * `RevealWorkspace` are the same components rendered from a different
 * parent, deliberately, so the two pages cannot drift apart. What is new is
 * only the frame around them: a close that says where to go next. There is no
 * hero — the page opens on the workspace, because the banner a hero would have
 * carried is the same timeline the first section is built from.
 *
 * The same two rules as `welcome.tsx` apply and are worth restating because
 * this file is easy to reach for when adding "just one live bit":
 *
 * 1. **Nothing here may call a query hook.** This page is prerendered by
 *    vite-react-ssg with no backend behind it and no `QueryClientProvider`
 *    above it. `useModels()` here would throw at render, not degrade.
 * 2. **It must not oversell.** Every claim below is checkable against the
 *    component that follows it or against the server source those components
 *    were transcribed from — the intent split in `server/src/llm/studio.ts`,
 *    the panel shortcuts in `routes/story.tsx`, the audio-to-audio routes in
 *    `docs/AUDIOCPP.md`. If a sentence here cannot be traced to one of those,
 *    it does not belong.
