/**
 * The shelf — everything you have started, in either builder.
 *
 * One index for two tools rather than two indexes, because a story is a story
 * whichever door it came through: the same timeline, the same clips, the same
 * export. What the builder decides is how you work on it, not where it is
 * kept. The tabs are how you find yours; `?builder=` is what a builder's
 * breadcrumb points at, so leaving the Script Builder lands you among scripts
 * rather than among everything.
 *
 * An index rather than a sidebar list: the list of pieces is not something you
 * need visible while working on one, and giving it a permanent column would
 * cost the builder width it uses better. You pick one, you go and work on it,
 * and the way back is the breadcrumb.
