/**
 * Voices — the marketing page for the speech side of Soundbox, at `/voices`.
 *
 * The site covered sound effects, music and the studio and said nothing about
 * voices, even though most of the catalog is voice models and the app has a
 * whole workflow for them: a one-off read (`speak`), scripts that persist as
 * stories with per-speaker lines on a timeline, and a Voice Lab where a cast
 * is built. This page closes that gap.
 *
 * The same two rules as `studio.tsx` apply:
 *
 * 1. **No query hooks.** Prerendered by vite-react-ssg, no backend, no
 *    `QueryClientProvider` above it — a hook from `@/lib/queries` would throw
 *    at render.
 * 2. **No overselling.** Every claim here traces to a source: the voice
 *    routes in `server/src/routes/voices.ts` (builtin vs clone, WAV upload),
 *    the story routes in `server/src/routes/stories.ts` (per-line generate,
 *    reorder, export, the SSE live view), the page docstrings in
 *    `routes/voice.tsx` / `routes/voice-lab.tsx` / `routes/story.tsx`, the
 *    delivery table in `docs/MCP.md`, and the catalog in
 *    `content/models/models.ts`. The model numbers below are *derived* from
 *    that file rather than written down, for the same reason `MODEL_STATS`
 *    is: a hand-maintained count is a lie waiting to happen.
 *
 * The licence section deliberately does not reproduce the licence table —
 * `/models` owns that, entry by entry with sources, and two copies would
 * drift. This page states the shape of the problem and links there.

                  Write lines, give each a speaker, and voice them one at a time. Generation is
                  per line, so when one read is wrong (a mispronounced word, a flat take) you
                  regenerate that line and leave the rest of the script alone.

                <p>
                  The lines sit on a multi-track timeline. You can move clips, split them,
                  reorder them and mute a lane. When you are done, the story exports as one mixed
                  WAV. Deleting a story keeps its audio in the library unless you choose to remove
                  that as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A story can also start from existing audio: hand it a library sound and it opens
                  as a story, optionally split into stems with each stem on its own lane.

                  <span className="text-foreground font-medium">165 controls</span> in total,
                  across sliders, numbers, toggles, choices and text. They are vendored from
                  audio.cpp&apos;s own parameter file and checked against its per-family source.
                  Delivery settings (&ldquo;how should this line be said&rdquo;) and sampler
                  settings (&ldquo;how hard should the sampler work&rdquo;) are grouped
                  separately.

                <p>
                  These are request options, and audio.cpp accepts unknown keys silently, so a
                  misspelled parameter produces no error. Because the panel is built from the real
                  definitions, it never shows a control that the model would ignore.

                <p>
                  The demo shows two behaviours from the app. Some parameters do nothing until
                  another is on, so dependent controls grey out until their gate is set. Only
                  values you change are sent: if you change nothing, the request carries no
                  options and the model&apos;s own defaults apply.

                  The same panel drives sound effects and music. It is shown here because voice
                  models have the most to tune.

                A connected agent can speak a one-off line, create a story, add lines with
                speakers and per-line delivery, revise them, and voice the result, through the
                same endpoints the app uses. Every generated file comes back with an absolute
                path, so the agent can pass narration to ffmpeg or drop it into a video project.
              </p>
              <p>
                The story page holds a live connection open, so lines an agent writes appear as
                they are written, without a refresh. The Agents page attributes every call to the
                client that made it.
