/**
 * Voice Lab — where a voice is made, named and kept.
 *
 * The Studio (`/voice`) is about a script; this page is about the cast. They
 * used to be one screen, with the library squeezed into a 20rem aside, which
 * made creating a voice feel like a side-effect of writing a line. Curating a
 * voice deserves the page: you are choosing what something sounds like, and
 * that decision is made by *listening*, not by reading a row in a list.
 *
 * So the two things this page adds over the old aside are room and ears. Room:
 * a responsive grid instead of a narrow column, with the reference clip and the
 * notes visible at a glance. Ears: a test read per voice, so a clone can be
 * judged before it is committed to a script — the whole reason someone opens
 * this page twice.
 *
 * Everything here writes through the same voice endpoints the Studio reads, so
 * a voice added mid-script and a voice added here are the same object; there is
 * no "lab copy" of anything.
