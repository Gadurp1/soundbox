/**
 * Activity — a window into what the server is actually doing.
 *
 * The backend writes a rotating log under the data directory with every
 * job-related line tagged by job id. That file is the real diagnostic tool,
 * but reading it means knowing where it lives and having a terminal open —
 * so this surfaces the tail of it in the app, parsed rather than dumped.
 *
 * The reading itself is `components/log-tail`, shared with the studio's Logs
 * panel: level and source come out as filters, and the job id becomes a
 * first-class thing you can click to isolate one generation's whole story.
 * What is left here is the page around it — the heading, the desktop shell's
 * backend health, and the `?job=` link the History panel arrives with.
