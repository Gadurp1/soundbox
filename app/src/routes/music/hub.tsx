/**
 * `/music` — the music landing page.
 *
 * An index, and only an index. Laid out after a streaming-dashboard reference
 * — hero, cover row, numbered track lists — but every track leads to its own
 * page rather than opening in place: `/music/:slug` is the page that carries
 * the player, the script and the render spec, and it is the page a search
 * result should land on. Duplicating any of that here would mean two surfaces
 * telling the same story and one of them going stale.
 *
 * What stays on the rows is the prompt. It is the only thing on this page a
 * competitor's grid of clips does not have, and it belongs in the markup of
 * the page that lists them all, not only on the pages behind them.
 *
 * Content lives in `@/content/music/tracks.ts`; this file decides only how it
 * is rendered. Like the `/sfx` pages it renders outside the app shell and must
 * keep working with no backend behind it — the static site build has none.

const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "Can I use this music in a commercial game or video?",
    answer:
      "It depends on which model rendered the track; every row names it. The instrumentals come from Stable Audio 3.0 Small Music, under the Stability AI Community License: free for commercial use below USD $1M annual revenue, Enterprise licence required above it. The sung tracks come from ACE-Step, listed as Apache 2.0 but flagged unverified in the model catalogue, so read its model card before shipping. Soundbox itself is MIT and imposes no terms on what you generate.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long can a generated track be?",
    answer:
      "Stable Audio 3.0 Small Music renders up to 120 seconds in one pass and ACE-Step up to 60. Everything on this page is about 20 seconds, loop or cue length. For anything longer than the limit, generate sections and arrange them.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which model should I use for music with vocals?",
    answer:
      "ACE-Step. Stable Audio has no vocal path and cannot sing words; ask it for a chorus and you get an instrumental with a lead line where the voice would be. ACE-Step takes a separate lyrics field and sings it verbatim, and the prompt sets genre and instrumentation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does this run in the cloud?",
    answer:
      "No. Both models run on your own machine through audio.cpp, a native binary, from quantised GGUF weights. There is no Python stack, account, API key or per-track billing. Once the weights are downloaded it works with the network off. The tracks on this page were rendered this way on one desktop GPU.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why do the durations not match what was requested?",
    answer:
      "Every track here asked for 20 seconds and came back between 10.7 and 20.0. Diffusion audio models render to a latent length that maps only approximately to seconds, so the requested duration is a target. If you need an exact length, generate longer than you need and trim.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can an agent generate these instead of me?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Soundbox exposes an MCP server, so a coding agent can call soundbox.generate with a prompt and a lyrics block and get back an absolute path to a WAV it can drop into a project. Every track on this page was produced through the HTTP API that server is built on.",
  },

              Twenty fictional acts, each with a house style. To a generative model an artist
              identity is a vocabulary held constant, so every act on this roster is a persona
              string, and its signature track was rendered from that string. Press play to
              hear the act. Copy the persona and append your own brief to render in its
              style.
