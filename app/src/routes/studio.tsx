/**
 * The studio floor — shared by both builders, and by neither exclusively.
 *
 * Soundbox has two tools that make sounds, and this file is the half they
 * have in common: a timeline, a library, a chat, a device rack, and the
 * plumbing that keeps a story's clips and its script in step. What the two
 * builders disagree about is small enough to be a prop.
 *
 *   Script Builder (`builder: "script"`) — you start from words. The script
 *   panel is beside the timeline, lines carry a speaker and a voice, and the
 *   thing you press is Speak.
 *
 *   Music Builder (`builder: "music"`) — you start from a prompt. There is no
 *   script panel at all: a column of "Write the line…" rows with a voice
 *   picker, sitting beside a bass stem, invites putting a spoken read on it.
 *   The Prompt panel takes its slot.
 *
 * This used to be one studio that worked out which it was by inspecting its
 * own clips — `isArrangement`: no words anywhere and audio everywhere meant
 * an arrangement. It was a decent guess and it is gone, because a guess
 * cannot be made at all on an empty story, which is exactly when the answer
 * matters. The choice is made at the "new sound" door instead (see
 * `new-studio-dialog`), stored on the story, and read here.
 *
 * What is *not* different: every panel a builder has, it has all the time.
 * The Script Builder still owns the Prompt panel and the device rack — a
 * scripted piece is exactly the sort of thing you drop a generated bed under
 * — they simply are not what it opens with.
 *
 * The page is two views of one list. On the left the script, in reading
 * order, where you write and voice each line; on the right the same lines in
 * time, where you arrange them. The timeline is the one that decides order —
 * moving a clip re-reads the script to match, see `lib/reading-order` — because the
 * order things happen in is the order they are read in.
 *
 * Generation is per line rather than per story. Regenerating one line is the
 * single most common thing you do to a script (a word was mispronounced, a
 * read was flat), and a page that could only re-speak the whole thing would
 * make that cost minutes instead of seconds.

          They were stacked, and the stack was the problem: a fifth of the
          window split three-to-two gave you a conversation four messages tall
          above a form you had to scroll to fill, and both were the *same
          request* at two levels of precision. You are never writing in one
          while reading the other; you pick how you want to say it. So one
          frame, one body, and a tab strip that says which.

          The chat used to be deliberately un-framed — everything else in the
          studio is a bordered artifact because everything else is a view *of
          the story*, and the chat is the thing you are talking to. That still
          holds for `soloChat`, which is bare. But a tab is a frame by
          definition, and a frame the Prompt shares is not a label saying
          "this box contains a chat" — it is the seam between two ways of
          asking. The close button belongs to the strip for the same reason,
          so the chat no longer needs its own ghost X floating over the
          thread.

          The script is not here: it is a view of the story, like the
          timeline, so it lives in the middle with it. */}

          exact opposite of what it looked like it would do. Here it takes
          the free width by default and keeps it when the timeline goes.

          Every panel in here has an X, this column included. It goes when
