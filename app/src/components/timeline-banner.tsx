/**
 * The studio timeline, as a banner — what the product looks like, above the fold.
 *
 * This is deliberately *not* `story-timeline.tsx`. That component is three
 * thousand lines wired to a live backend: a player store, a recorder, Web Audio
 * decoding, drag-and-drop, device chains and server-backed segment mutations.
 * None of that can exist on a prerendered marketing page with no server behind
 * it, and none of it is what a first-time visitor needs to see. What they need
 * is the *shape* of the thing — clips on lanes, arranged in time, a playhead
 * moving through them — which is a picture, not an application.
 *
 * So this borrows the real vocabulary and none of the machinery: the same lane
 * hues from `lib/lanes` (so the colours here are the colours you get), the same
 * clip-on-a-ruler layout, the same idea that a lane is an instrument and a clip
 * is a sound. It plays no audio and accepts no input.
 *
 * It animates because a still timeline reads as a screenshot, and a screenshot
 * of a timeline is indistinguishable from every other DAW screenshot. Movement
 * is what says "these are separate sounds at separate moments". It stops for
 * `prefers-reduced-motion`, parking the playhead mid-arrangement with the clips
 * under it lit — the same bargain `docs/islands/signal-chain.tsx` makes.
