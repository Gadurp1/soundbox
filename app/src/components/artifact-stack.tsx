/**
 * A column of artifact panels: stacked, collapsible, and resizable against
 * each other.
 *
 * The studio's right-hand side used to be one panel — the timeline — with the
 * transport pinned somewhere else on the page. That does not survive contact
 * with a second thing worth looking at while you arrange: the clip you have
 * selected, its waveform, and where it came from. So the column became a
 * stack, and each panel in it is an artifact you open, close, and give as much
 * height as it is currently worth.
 *
 * Three rules make it behave like a panel stack rather than a list of cards:
 *
 * - **Bodies stay mounted when collapsed**, hidden rather than removed. The
 *   timeline owns the story's audio graph; unmounting it to save a few
 *   hundred pixels would stop playback, which is not what closing a panel
 *   means anywhere.
 * - **Height is weight, not pixels.** Panels share what is left after the
 *   collapsed headers, so the split survives the window resizing, the sidebar
 *   opening, and a panel above being closed.
 * - **A handle only exists between two open panels.** There is nothing to
 *   trade height with otherwise, and a drag target that does nothing is worse
 *   than no drag target.
