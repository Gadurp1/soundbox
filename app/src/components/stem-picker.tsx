/**
 * Choosing which stems come out of a split.
 *
 * Splitting is a destructive-feeling action with a slow middle: a minute of
 * separation, then four new sounds whether or not you wanted four. Both
 * surfaces that can start one — the Library card and the studio timeline —
 * ask the same two questions here rather than each growing their own form,
 * because the answers mean the same thing in both places and the second one
 * is easy to get wrong: what happens to the stems you did *not* pick.
 *
 * The names offered are the usual four (`COMMON_STEM_NAMES`). What a
 * separator actually writes is up to its loader family, so a selection is
 * matched loosely on the server and anything it cannot find is reported
 * rather than silently dropped — see `server/src/stems.ts`.
