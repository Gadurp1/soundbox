/**
 * The one row that stands for a render that hasn't finished yet.
 *
 * Every surface that both lists sounds and can start one needs the same
 * thing: the sound you just asked for, sitting in the list it is about to
 * join, saying what stage it is at. The Music studio grew this first; the SFX
 * and Text to Speech pages need it for the same reason, and three hand-rolled
 * copies of a spinner-plus-phase row is how three pages end up disagreeing
 * about what "queued" looks like.
 *
 * `job` is the live stream for this row's job, or null. Null is not an error
 * state — a submission that has not been picked up yet, or one queued behind
 * another, has no stream of its own to read — so the row falls back to
 * "Queued" and a zero-width bar rather than showing nothing.
