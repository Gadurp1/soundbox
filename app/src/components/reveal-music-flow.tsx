/**
 * One track, from the prompt to an arrangement — and the fork at the top of
 * that path: whether it sings.
 *
 * `/music` lists thirty-six finished renders and the prompt behind each one.
 * What it never showed is the *shape of the job*: that "make music" is two
 * different model paths with two different inputs, that the sung ones take
 * their words as a separate field rather than as more prompt, and that a
 * finished mix is not the end of it because separation turns it back into
 * parts. Those are the things a list of results cannot teach.
 *
 * **The mode toggle is the argument, so it is a real control.** The division
 * on this page is not a stylistic preference: Stable Audio 3.0 Small Music has
 * no vocal path at all, and ACE-Step is the lyrics-conditioned model — see the
 * docstring in `content/music/tracks.ts`, which is why the page splits its
 * track lists by model in the first place. A reader told that in prose has to
 * take it on faith; a reader who flips the switch and watches the lyrics field
 * appear along with a different model name has seen it. Everything downstream
 * — the model credit, the render, which stem carries a voice — follows from
 * the one toggle, which is the same trick `model-params-demo.tsx` plays with
 * its family tabs.
 *
 * **The two example tracks are real and imported, not written here.** Both
 * prompts (and the lyrics block) come straight out of `content/music/tracks.ts`
 * and are the exact strings sent to the models, so the panel cannot drift away
 * from the rows further down the same page. Rejected: transcribing a prompt
 * into this file, which would have been one copy-edit away from being a lie.
 *
 * Claims and their sources, so a later edit can check them:
 *   - two models, split by lyrics support — `content/music/tracks.ts` docstring
 *   - prompt sets genre and production, lyrics are what is sung — `docs/AUDIOCPP.md`, "Lyrics"
 *   - some models refuse to run without lyrics (MiniMax Music 3), so Soundbox
 *     sends an explicit `[instrumental]` marker — same section
 *   - htdemucs emits vocals / drums / bass / other, is its own task mode, and
 *     needs exactly 44.1 kHz so the source is resampled first — `docs/AUDIOCPP.md`,
 *     "Separation"
 *
 * Deliberately *not* claimed: what the vocals stem contains when an
 * instrumental render is separated. htdemucs emits four stems regardless, but
 * nothing in the docs says what lands in the vocal one for a track with no
 * voice, so the panel labels that row and stays quiet about its contents.
 *
 * Prerendered and backend-free like the rest of `/music`: every waveform comes
 * from the seeded, quantized generators in `lib/studio-scene.ts`, so the
 * markup is byte-identical across the SSR/hydration boundary.
