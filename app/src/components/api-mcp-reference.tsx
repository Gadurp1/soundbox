/**
 * API & MCP — the whole HTTP and MCP surface, as one reference.
 *
 * This is a component, not a route, because there is exactly one place it is
 * rendered: the public site's `/docs/reference` page (`site/src/routes/docs.tsx`).
 * It used to be a route too — `/developers` inside the app — and that is
 * precisely the problem it was causing. Two copies of the same reference meant
 * two things to keep current, and they drifted: the in-app copy still claimed
 * MCP exposed five tools long after the server grew to twenty. Consolidating on
 * the public docs leaves one canonical reference for a developer to read, and
 * one place to fix when the server changes. The app keeps `/agents`, which is a
 * different thing — a live dashboard of this instance's MCP connection, not
 * documentation.
 *
 * Where the content comes from:
 *
 *  - The HTTP API's full endpoint index is `docs/API.md`, rendered by the site
 *    at /docs/api. This page carries the quickstart and links there rather
 *    than keeping a second copy of ninety-odd routes to drift. (It used to:
 *    a reference generated from the Python server's OpenAPI document, which
 *    outlived that server by months.)
 *  - The MCP reference is hand-written in `components/mcp-reference.tsx` from
 *    `content/mcp/tools.ts`, transcribed from `server/src/mcp/server.ts`.
 *
 * Every example is built from `apiOrigin()` so a copied command hits the server
 * the reader is actually running.
