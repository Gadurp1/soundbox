/**
 * The studio assistant — a conversation that ends in a prompt.
 *
 * The Generate thread is a record of renders: you ask, audio comes back. This
 * is the other kind of thread, the one *before* a render: which model, why,
 * what the licence allows, what a prompt for that model should actually say.
 * It asks what it needs, explains what it knows, and when it has enough it
 * writes the request out as a card.
 *
 * It is a panel of both builders (see `routes/studio`) rather than a page of
 * its own, which is what makes it useful: the thread sits beside the timeline
 * it is talking about. What it proposes lands where the work is — the Prompt
 * panel one column over, already filled in — so the next thing you do is
 * "Generate & insert" rather than a copy and paste.
 *
 * Inside a studio (see `lib/studio-bridge.ts`) the same box also takes
 * instructions *about* that timeline — "name all the tracks",
 * "mute 1 and 3", "put a reverb on the vocal". Those go through the studio's
 * own planner (`/api/studio/command`, the vocabulary the command bar uses)
 * and its own apply handler, so an edit asked for in the chat is the same
 * edit as one asked for under the timeline: optimistic, and one Ctrl+Z away.
 * A turn the planner calls a description rather than an edit falls through
 * to the assistant, which is how one box serves both.
 *
 * Nothing is run from here without a person behind it: plain edits apply
 * as the command bar's Apply would, because undo covers them; anything that
 * deletes waits for a click.
