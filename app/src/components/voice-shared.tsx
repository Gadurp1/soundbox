/**
 * Pieces shared by the two voice surfaces — the Lab (`/voice/lab`, where a
 * voice is made and curated) and the Studio (`/voice`, where a script is read).
 *
 * The split exists because those are two different jobs with two different
 * rhythms: making a voice is a one-off act of curation you do rarely and want
 * room for, while writing a script is the thing you come back to every day.
 * What they genuinely share is small — the notion of what a voice *is*, the way
 * a job reports progress, and the one dialog that can create a voice — and it
 * lives here rather than being duplicated or imported page-to-page, so neither
 * page owns the other.
 *
 * The constants and helpers below sit in the same file as the components on
 * purpose — they are the *same* shared vocabulary, and splitting them into a
 * fourth module to satisfy the fast-refresh lint would scatter one idea across
 * two files for a dev-only convenience neither page relies on.
