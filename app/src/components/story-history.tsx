/**
 * What happened in this studio, in order.
 *
 * The panel this replaces was the Prompt box's own render log: a
 * `localStorage` array of the things *that panel* generated, in one browser.
 * Everything else a person did here — every question, every edit the
 * assistant applied, every line it wrote — left no trace, which made
 * "History" a name the panel did not earn.
 *
 * It is deliberately not the Activity page. That reads the server's rotating
 * log and answers "what is the backend doing, and why did this fail": levels,
 * sources, job ids, global and ephemeral. This answers "what did I do", per
 * studio, and survives the browser. Where they meet is `job_id` — an entry
 * that ran a job says so, and that is the thread across to the diagnostics.
 *
 * An entry can carry words, effects and results in any combination, so the
 * row renders whichever of the three it has rather than assuming a shape.
