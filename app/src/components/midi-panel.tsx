/**
 * The MIDI panel — play notes, keep them, turn them into a clip.
 *
 * This is the front half of a two-stage idea. Nothing in the model catalogue
 * takes notes as input, so "play a line and hear it as a violin in a large
 * hall" is not one call: the notes are performed here and rendered by a plain
 * synth (`lib/midi.ts`), and the *timbre* is asked for afterwards by covering
 * that clip with ACE-Step, which is already what the timeline's right-click
 * Cover does to any clip. This panel therefore stops at "a clip on a lane" and
 * hands over to machinery the studio already had.
 *
 * It stores no MIDI. A note list lives here while you play it, becomes a WAV,
 * and the WAV is what the story keeps — the same path a microphone take takes,
 * for the same reason: the export reads clips off disk, so a take that existed
 * only in the browser could be arranged and then vanish from its own mixdown.
 * The cost is that a placed clip cannot be re-edited as notes. That is the
 * right trade for now; a clip that *is* notes is a change to the story
 * document, and it is a much bigger change than this panel.
 *
 * Three ways in, because the first two each fail somewhere:
 *
 * - A **MIDI keyboard**, where the browser allows it — not WKWebView, which is
 *   what the desktop build runs inside on macOS.
 * - The **on-screen keyboard**, which always works, mouse or QWERTY.
 * - A **`.mid` file**, which is how you get a real piece of music in here
 *   without being able to play one.
