/** Step 4 — the two optional engines.
 *
 * The prompt assistant and the artwork model are the best parts of the app
 * that nobody discovers, because both are off by default and both live behind
 * a settings page. This step is the one moment they are cheap to explain: two
 * rows, what each actually gets you, what it costs to download, off unless
 * you say otherwise.
 *
 * Off by default here as well, deliberately. They are extra gigabytes on top
 * of an audio model someone is already waiting for, and defaulting them on
 * would make the first download twice as long for a feature they did not ask
 * for. Both are one switch away on Settings afterwards, which is what the
 * closing line says. */
