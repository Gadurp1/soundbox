/** Step 2 — will you sell what you make?
 *
 * Asked once here so it never has to be asked again per download. Roughly a
 * third of the catalog is non-commercial, and the difference between a model
 * you can ship and one you cannot is the single most consequential fact about
 * a pick — see `components/license-badge`. Answering "commercial" removes
 * those models from the recommendations entirely rather than ranking them
 * down: a wall is not a preference.
 *
 * Nothing is locked in by the answer. Every model stays installable from the
 * Models page, behind the same say-it-out-loud confirmation it has always
 * had. */
