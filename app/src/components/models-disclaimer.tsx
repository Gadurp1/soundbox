/**
 * The disclaimer that appears on every `/models` page, and the short
 * explainer of what audio.cpp is.
 *
 * These two live in one file because they are one argument. Soundbox is a
 * *sourcing* layer: it points audio.cpp at weights on Hugging Face that you
 * download, under your own account, from people we have nothing to do with.
 * Everything on these pages — the specs, the licences, the "verified" marks —
 * is our reading of somebody else's work, and our reading can be wrong or
 * out of date. Saying that once, plainly, in the same voice as the rest of
 * the site, beats scattering asterisks.
 *
 * The deliberate omission here is **logos**. No Stability, Alibaba, Microsoft
 * or MiniMax marks appear anywhere on these pages, and that is a decision
 * rather than a to-do:
 *
 *   - A vendor's mark on a page is read as that vendor's involvement in it.
 *     That directly contradicts the paragraph below, and the disclaimer is
 *     the more important of the two.
 *   - The site is prerendered and self-contained. Hotlinking a logo adds a
 *     third-party request to a static page and a trademark question to a
 *     repo that has neither.
 *
 * Models get a monogram tile instead (see `models-list.tsx`), the same
 * two-letter fallback `routes/sfx/hub.tsx` uses for a category without art.
