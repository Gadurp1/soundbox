/**
 * The fixed, full-width bottom dock — one player idiom shared by every page
 * that needs "the thing playing stays on screen while you do something else".
 *
 * Originally written for `/music/:slug` (the marketing track page) and lifted
 * out here so the app's own `NowPlayingBar` (opened from a Library row, see
 * `sound-card.tsx`) uses the exact same component rather than a re-styled
 * copy of it. The two callers differ only in what goes on the left (a cover
 * vs nothing), what plays in the middle (`/music` swaps in a failed/loading
 * state before its manifest resolves) and what trails the waveform (download
 * vs close) — all three are props; the position, blur, border and layout are
 * one definition.
