/**
 * What you can do to a clip once you have one — extend, cover, repaint,
 * separate — drawn as what each one does to the same waveform.
 *
 * These are the audio-to-audio routes and the separation task mode from
 * `docs/AUDIOCPP.md`, and they are the least self-evident thing Soundbox
 * does. "Cover" and "repaint" are words a reader either already knows from a
 * DAW or has to be shown, and a bullet list shows nothing. Holding one source
 * clip fixed and changing only what the route does to it is the difference
 * between naming four features and explaining them.
 *
 * The distinction the drawing has to carry is which samples survive. Extend
 * keeps the source bit-for-bit and appends — it is implemented as a repaint
 * whose window starts past the end, which is *why* it survives. Repaint
 * replaces a window and keeps both edges. Cover re-renders everything at the
 * original length. Separation keeps all of it and splits it four ways. Those
 * are four genuinely different answers and the colour split says so.
