/**
 * The MCP half of the Developers page: how to connect a client, what the tools
 * actually take, what a real agent turn looks like, and what to do when the
 * connection does not come up.
 *
 * The tool list is not transcribed here any more. It lives in
 * `@/content/mcp/tools`, derived from `server/src/mcp/server.ts` — the MCP tool
 * surface is defined by `registerTool` calls and zod schemas rather than by the
 * OpenAPI document, so unlike the HTTP reference this part cannot be generated
 * from `/openapi.json`. It used to be a local array, and it drifted: five tools
 * documented against twenty on the server, and a citation of
 * `backend/src/soundbox/mcp_server.py`, a Python module deleted when the server
 * moved to TypeScript. Sharing one content module with the marketing page makes
 * that drift show up in two places at once instead of hiding in this file.
 *
 * The Claude-side setup steps are written as text rather than screenshots on
 * purpose. Product UI moves; `claude mcp add --transport http …` and the shape
 * of a config file do not, and an instruction that says exactly what to type
 * survives a redesign that would leave a screenshot lying.

          <strong className="text-foreground">Getting 421 Misdirected Request?</strong> The MCP SDK
          arms DNS-rebinding protection with a localhost-only host allowlist. That is right for a
          local app, but it rejects requests arriving under any other hostname — which is what
          happens if you bound the server to <C>0.0.0.0</C> and connect by LAN address or container
          name. Set <C>SOUNDBOX_ALLOWED_HOSTS</C> to a comma-separated list of the hosts you
          actually use.
