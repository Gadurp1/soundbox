/**
 * The way out of a take: render it, and put it on the timeline.
 *
 * Shared by the MIDI panel and the piano roll rather than owned by either,
 * because a take can be finished from either one — you might play a phrase and
 * place it without ever opening the roll, or draw the whole thing in the roll
 * without touching the keyboard. An action that lived in only one panel would
 * make the other a dead end, which is exactly what it was before this existed.
 *
 * Everything it needs is in `midi-store` — the notes, the instrument, the
 * prompt, the strength — so both copies are the same controls over the same
 * state, not two forms that have to be kept in sync.
