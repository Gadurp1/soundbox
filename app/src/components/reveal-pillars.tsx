/**
 * The whole product as one pipeline, a step at a time.
 *
 * The landing page had a shape problem rather than a content problem. It could
 * show one generation end to end (`reveal-prompt-to-sample`) and it could point
 * at the studio, but the four pillar pages — /sfx, /music, /voices, /studio —
 * were only reachable from the header, so a first-time reader could finish the
 * page believing Soundbox is a sound-effect box that happens to have a timeline
 * bolted on. The parts are not four features. They are one prompt box with
 * three kinds of output and one workspace they all land in.
 *
 * So this section is deliberately *one* window that keeps its frame the whole
 * way down while its contents change. The alternative considered and rejected
 * was four side-by-side cards, one per pillar: a grid says "here are four
 * things", and four things is exactly the wrong reading. A single window whose
 * output area swaps while the prompt row above it stays put says "same box,
 * different answer", which is the claim.
 *
 * Two smaller decisions worth naming:
 *
 * **The rail scrubs, the footer links.** The pills across the top select a step
 * (via `ScrollStage`'s `select`, which scrolls rather than overriding — see its
 * docstring), so a reader can jump straight to the beat they care about. The
 * real `<Link>` per step lives in the footer and every one of them stays in the
 * DOM, cross-faded rather than swapped, because this page is prerendered and a
 * pillar page only gets crawled if there is an href pointing at it. Making the
 * rail itself the links was tried first and cannot work: a click would navigate
 * away instead of scrubbing, which loses the only interaction the section has.
 *
 * **Nothing here invents a second scene.** The waveforms come from
 * `lib/studio-scene`'s seeded, quantized generators — the same ones the
 * timeline banner and the prompt-to-sample reveal draw from — so the clips a
 * reader sees here are the same kind of shape as the clips everywhere else,
 * and the markup is byte-identical between Node and the browser.
