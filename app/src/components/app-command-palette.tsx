/**
 * The app-wide palette: ⌘K anywhere in the shell.
 *
 * It indexes what you would otherwise go looking for: recent sounds, the
 * stories, the voices, the models, the pages, and the profiles. Settings rows
 * are in the index too but stay out of the default list until something is
 * typed, so the first screen is the things you jump to, not a settings menu.
 * The first row is contextual: Generate when a page with a composer is
 * showing and the box has words in it, Cancel while a job runs.
 *
 * Anything that acts on the open document belongs to that page's own
 * palette instead. The list component is `command-palette.tsx`, which knows
 * how to choose a command and nothing about what any of them do.
