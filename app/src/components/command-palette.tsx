/**
 * A filterable list of commands, over the page.
 *
 * The studio has six panels that can each be open or shut, and three ways to
 * say so: the Panels menu, a keyboard shortcut per panel, and this. They exist
 * for different moments rather than out of indecision — the menu is for when
 * you are already reading the toolbar, the shortcuts are for when you know
 * exactly what you want, and this is for when you know the *name* but not the
 * key, which is most of the time until a shortcut is in your fingers.
 *
 * Deliberately not a `cmdk` dependency. What a palette needs over a plain list
 * is a filter, arrow keys, and Enter — about forty lines — and the alternative
 * is a package whose styling has to be argued back into this app's own.
 *
 * The commands themselves are passed in. This component knows how to choose
 * one and nothing about what any of them do.
