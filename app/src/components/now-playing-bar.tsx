/**
 * The app's fixed bottom player — `PlayerDock` (see `player-dock.tsx`), the
 * same dock `/music/:slug` uses, wired to the player store instead of a
 * hardcoded track.
 *
 * Opened by clicking a sound's title or cover tile in the Library (see
 * `sound-card.tsx`) rather than its own inline waveform — the row's compact
 * player is a quick local preview, this is "play it and keep it on screen
 * while I go do something else". The shared `playingId` in the player store
 * keeps the two from both being audible at once (see the "somebody else took
 * over" effect in `waveform-player.tsx`).
 *
 * `key={sound.id}` forces a remount on every new sound so `autoPlay` fires
 * again — `WaveformPlayer` only starts playback on mount, by design.
