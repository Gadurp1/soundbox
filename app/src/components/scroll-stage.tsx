/**
 * A sticky product shot that stays put while the page scrolls past a tall
 * spacer behind it, with the copy beside it changing as you go. The mechanism
 * the three `reveal-*` sections are built on.
 *
 * Two things it deliberately owns rather than leaving to each reveal:
 *
 * **The copy lives here, not inside the product.** The first version of this
 * put the step description in a `<figcaption>` inside the mockup's own frame,
 * which made the explanation look like part of the application's UI — a
 * caption bar no screen in Soundbox actually has. Out here it is plainly the
 * page talking about the product rather than the product talking about
 * itself, and it can cross-fade between steps instead of hard-swapping.
 *
 * **Layout is a parameter.** Three sections in a row with the panel centred
 * under a heading reads as one component repeated three times. Alternating
 * text-left / centred / text-right is what makes them read as a sequence.
 *
 * The spacer is `steps * vhPerStep` tall — scroll distance is how this trades
 * against feeling either rushed (too little) or like the page has stopped
 * responding (too much). Keep it low: three of these on one page multiply,
 * and everything below them is pushed down by the total.
