/**
 * A video on the public site: poster first, plays on click, with a caption.
 *
 * Every clip here is about sound, so none of them autoplays. A muted loop of a
 * product whose whole point is what it sounds like shows the wrong half of it,
 * and a click-to-play clip needs no reduced-motion fallback because nothing
 * moves until someone asks it to. `preload="none"` keeps the page weight at the
 * poster: the MP4 is fetched only when it is played.
 *
 * The files live in `site/public/media/` (posters in `media/posters/`), so they
 * are served by the site build only. Paths go through `assetUrl` for the
 * `/soundbox/` base on GitHub Pages.
