/**
 * Real screenshots of the running app, switchable.
 *
 * Everything else on this site that looks like Soundbox is a drawing of it —
 * `timeline-banner`, the `reveal-*` panels, `model-params-demo`. Those exist to
 * animate and to be interactive, which a screenshot cannot be, and they are
 * honest about being illustrations. But a visitor deciding whether to install
 * something eventually wants the unglamorous question answered: *what does it
 * actually look like*. Only a screenshot answers that.
 *
 * These were captured from the app running in its mock mode (`npm run dev:mock`
 * — no backend, seeded data), at 1600×1000, dark theme. Mock rather than a live
 * install because it is reproducible: anyone can re-shoot these and get the same
 * frames, which is what stops them rotting silently.
 *
 * Two things were fixed in `lib/mock.ts` while capturing, because a screenshot
 * is a claim and these two were false ones:
 *
 *   - The seeded sounds were credited to `Stable Audio Open Small`,
 *     `TangoFlux Base` and `AudioGen Medium` — Python-era models that are not in
 *     the audio.cpp catalog at all. A product shot naming models the /models page
 *     does not list is worse than no product shot.
 *   - The Agents page showed `uv run soundbox-mcp` as the stdio bridge command.
 *     `uv` is Python tooling and had to go, but the fix is not `npx
 *     soundbox-mcp` either — `soundbox-mcp` is a private package, so npx
 *     cannot resolve it, and `npm install` only links the bin into the
 *     checkout's own `node_modules/.bin`, off any editor's spawn `PATH`. The
 *     real command is by absolute path — `node
 *     /path/to/soundbox/server/dist/mcp/stdio.js` — which is what
 *     `docs/MCP.md` documents and what the Agents page actually prints,
 *     resolved for the install it's running on.
 *
 * The images live in `site/public/product/`, the site build's `publicDir`, so
 * they are served from `/product/*.png` on the site and never ship in the app
 * bundle.
