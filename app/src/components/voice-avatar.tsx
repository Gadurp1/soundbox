 * `voice-shared` pulls in the recorder, the add-voice dialog and `SoundCard`

/**
 * A voice's avatar, or its initial.
 *
 * The fallback is a letter on a tinted tile rather than a generic person
 * glyph: at 40px a stock silhouette is indistinguishable between rows, while
 * an initial is the one thing that already differs per voice. It is also the
 * same fallback `MusicCover` uses, so absent artwork looks deliberate across
 * the app rather than broken in two different ways.
 *
 * `artwork` is optional on the wire, so a server that predates this renders
 * initials everywhere instead of erroring.
 *
 * Size and radius come from `className` (`size-10 rounded-lg` by default, the
 * card size) so the same component covers a 40px card tile and a 16px pill
 * without a variant prop: both branches run the override through `cn`, which
 * is tailwind-merge, so a passed `size-4` genuinely replaces `size-10` rather
 * than losing to source order.
