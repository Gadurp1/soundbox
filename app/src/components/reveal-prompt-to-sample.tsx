/**
 * Prompt → sample, revealed a phase at a time as you scroll.
 *
 * The claim this section has to land is that a sentence becomes a file on
 * your disk, locally, with nothing hidden in between. A paragraph asserting
 * that reads like every other generative-audio pitch. Watching the phases go
 * past — and watching the waveform actually draw itself during `generating`
 * rather than appearing finished — is the version of the claim that shows its
 * working.
 *
 * The phase names are the server's own (`JobPhase` in `server/src/schemas.ts`:
 * queued → installing → loading → downloading → generating → encoding →
 * done). `installing` and `downloading` are dropped here because they only
 * happen on a first run, and a sequence that shows them every time would be
 * describing an unusual case as if it were the normal one.
 *
 * Nothing is generated and nothing is played. It is a drawing of a job, built
 * from the same `lib/studio-scene` peak generator the timeline banner uses so
 * the waveform that lands here is the same kind of shape as the ones on the
 * timeline further down the page.
