/**
 * The search box every index page uses.
 *
 * This existed twice before it existed once: models.tsx grew a
 * `SearchFilterBar`, voice-lab.tsx copied its input verbatim, and the comment
 * there explained the copy as "keeps the two pages looking identical without
 * coupling them". That reasoning holds for the *filters* beside the box, which
 * are genuinely per-page — a model's category tabs mean nothing on a voice —
 * but not for the box itself, which was the same twenty lines in both.
 *
 * So only the box is shared. Each page keeps its own filter row and puts this
 * in it, which is what let Projects and Agents get search without a fourth
 * copy appearing.
