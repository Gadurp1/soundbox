/**
 * Licence display for the `/models` marketing pages.
 *
 * Why this exists next to `components/license-badge.tsx` rather than reusing
 * it: that component renders the app's `LicenseInfo`, whose `commercial` is
 * `"yes" | "conditional" | "no"` — three states, because the running app
 * always has *some* answer to show. Research has a fourth state. "Nobody here
 * has read a licence for these weights" is not "no", and rendering it as a red
 * non-commercial chip would be as wrong as rendering it green.
 *
 * So: same visual language and the same colour semantics, one extra state, and
 * a panel that always shows where the claim came from. See
 * `content/models/types.ts` for why "unknown" is load-bearing.
