/**
 * Asking the studio for an edit, and watching it come back as a list of
 * operations you can read before any of them happen.
 *
 * This is the section that has to carry the least believable claim on the
 * page — "talk to it and it edits your arrangement" — which is exactly why it
 * shows the intermediate step rather than a before and after. The interesting
 * part is not that a sentence becomes a change; it is that the change arrives
 * as `Add reverb to track 3` on screen, in the same words `describeAction`
 * puts in the real preview, before anything is applied.
 *
 * The action strings, the intents and the device kinds are all real: see
 * `server/src/llm/studio.ts` for the `StudioAction` union and the
 * `edit | generate_clip | compose | script | panel` intent split, and
 * `app/src/lib/studio-command.ts` for the previews. Three properties of that
 * design are worth more than any adjective and are said plainly in the copy:
 * the model picks from ids it was handed rather than naming things, it returns
 * data rather than running anything, and the page applies each action through
 * the same hook a human's click goes through — so an agentic edit lands on the
 * undo stack exactly like a manual one.
