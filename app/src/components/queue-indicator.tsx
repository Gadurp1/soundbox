/**
 * What is generating, what is waiting, and how to take something out.
 *
 * The queue has always been real — `JobManager` serialises one worker, numbers
 * every waiting job and can cancel one that has not started — but nothing in
 * the app ever showed it. You could stack renders from the chat composer and
 * then have no way to see them, no way to know which was third, and no way to
 * drop the one you queued by mistake short of cancelling whatever happened to
 * be playing through `cancelCurrent`.
 *
 * It lives in the header rather than beside any one composer because a job
 * queued in the Music Builder is still running while you are reading the
 * Models page, and because an MCP agent's generations land in the same queue
 * as yours. One place, visible from everywhere, or it is not a queue — it is a
 * property of whichever screen you happened to submit from.
 *
 * Hidden entirely when nothing is in flight. A permanent "0 queued" chip is
 * furniture.
