/**
 * The door into a new piece of work — and the one place that asks which tool
 * it belongs in.
 *
 * Soundbox has two builders now, not one studio that guesses. They share the
 * timeline, the library and the chat; what differs is what you start from. In
 * the Script Builder you start from words: a script beside the timeline, a
 * cast, lines you voice and re-voice. In the Music Builder you start from a
 * prompt: a request form, takes, and clips you push around. A story used to
 * work out which of those it was by inspecting its own clips — which cannot
 * be done at all on an empty one, and that is precisely the moment you need
 * the answer.
 *
 * So the question is asked once, up front, at every entry point: the sidebar,
 * the dashboard, the shelf, the command palette. Two cards, one click each.
 * The answer is stored on the story (`Story.builder`), which is what decides
 * the URL it opens at and the panels it opens with.
