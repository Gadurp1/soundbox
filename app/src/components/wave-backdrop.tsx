/**
 * The faint animated texture behind a section, instead of flat black.
 *
 * Purely decoration, and it has to stay that way: the reveals in front of it
 * are the content, and a background that competes with them is worse than no
 * background at all. Hence the very low opacity, the mask that fades it out
 * top and bottom, and the slow speeds — a minute or more per pass for anything
 * that travels, which reads as drift rather than as something moving.
 *
 * **One layer, not two.** The first version stacked two waves at different
 * speeds for parallax. Two layers of the same motif is depth you have to look
 * for, and looking is exactly what a background should not ask for; the cost
 * was double the nodes and double the composited area on a page that already
 * runs scroll maths. What replaced it is variety *between* sections rather
 * than within one — see `BackdropVariant`. The page now reads as one texture
 * system in four registers rather than the same wave five times.
 *
 * The drifting variants (`waveform`, `halftone`) are built from generators in
 * `lib/studio-scene` that tile seamlessly, so the element holds two copies of
 * the pattern side by side and slides exactly half its own width forever. That
 * is what makes the loop invisible; see the keyframes in `index.css` for why
 * it is `translate3d`. The in-place variants (`eq`, `rings`) have no tiling to
 * preserve — their loop is per element, in CSS.
