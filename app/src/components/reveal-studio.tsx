/**
 * The studio, built up one lane at a time as you scroll.
 *
 * The banner at the top of the page shows a finished arrangement, which
 * answers "what does it look like" but not "how did it get that way". This
 * answers the second one: a bed, then footsteps over it, then the impacts that
 * carry the scene, then the designed layer underneath — which is the actual
 * order a person works in, and the argument for why a generator needs a
 * timeline attached rather than a download button.
 *
 * The last step hands the playhead to the scrollbar: keep scrolling and you
 * scrub it across the finished arrangement, clips lighting as it crosses them.
 * That is the one moment on the page where the motion is unambiguously the
 * reader's own, which is why it is the note to end on.
 *
 * Clip geometry, lane colours and waveform peaks all come from
 * `lib/studio-scene`, the same data the banner draws — so this is literally
 * the same arrangement seen mid-construction, not a second invented one that
 * would drift out of step with it.
