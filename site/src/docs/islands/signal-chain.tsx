/**
 * What happens between a prompt and a WAV, drawn as the path it takes.
 *
 * An island rather than a diagram file: the stages are the real ones, the
 * labels come from the same vocabulary the server's job phases use
 * (`queued → loading → generating → encoding → done`), and hovering or
 * focusing a stage says what it does. When a stage is "running" the pulse
 * travels the wire, so the picture shows the *order* of things rather than
 * just their names.
 *
 * It animates by itself because this is the first thing on the page and a
 * still diagram of a pipeline does not read as a pipeline. It stops for
 * `prefers-reduced-motion`, keeping the highlight and dropping the travel —
 * the same bargain the app's own "being read" outline makes.
