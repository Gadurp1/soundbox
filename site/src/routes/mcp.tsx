/**
 * `/mcp` — the marketing entry point for the MCP server.
 *
 * This is not `/docs/mcp`. That page is the reference: every tool, every
 * argument, the stdio bridge, the telemetry export — written for somebody who
 * has already decided to connect and needs to know what the server accepts.
 * This page is for somebody who hasn't decided yet, and whose whole question is
 * "what is this and why would I point my agent at it". So it makes the argument
 * once (the audio, the model and the agent are all on your machine, so the
 * integration is a path instead of a payload), shows the one line of config,
 * lists the tools at a glance, and hands off to the reference for the detail.
 *
 * Everything factual here is sourced: the port from `server/src/config.ts`, the
 * tool list from `@/content/mcp/tools.ts`, the model licences from
 * `@/content/models/models.ts`. Nothing on this page should be a claim you
 * cannot follow back to one of those.
 *
 * Site-only, so no `AppTopNav` — the site's own `SiteHeader` wraps it.

const FAQS: { question: string; answer: string }[] = [
  {
    question: "What is MCP?",
    answer:
      "The Model Context Protocol is an open standard for giving an AI agent tools it can call. Soundbox runs an MCP server inside its own process, so an agent connected to it can generate sound effects, music and speech, and arrange them, without you leaving the conversation you are already in.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which clients work with it?",
    answer:
      "Anything that speaks MCP. Claude Code takes the HTTP URL as a single command; Claude Desktop, Cursor and the rest take a JSON config block with the same URL. Clients that only speak stdio can use the bundled stdio bridge, which proxies onto the running server and loads no models itself.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need an API key?",
    answer:
      "No. There is no key and no account, because there is no auth and no cloud: the server listens on 127.0.0.1 and the agent runs on the same machine. Over HTTP there is nothing to install on the agent's side.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does it cost per generation?",
    answer:
      "Nothing. Generation runs on your own GPU from open-weight models you have downloaded, so there is no per-second billing and no subscription for model access. Soundbox itself is MIT-licensed.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a generation take?",
    answer:
      "Seconds to a minute, depending on the model and the length of the clip. The tool call blocks until the audio is written to disk, so the agent receives a finished file and has no job id to poll.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use the output commercially?",
    answer:
      "It depends on the model. Each model's licence is stated on its page, and the list_models tool reports commercial_use as yes, no or conditional, so an agent working on something commercial can check before it generates.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does anything leave my machine?",
    answer:
      "No. The weights are on your disk, the inference runs on your machine, and the WAV is written to your filesystem.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use it with my own agent?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Any MCP client can connect over HTTP with the same URL; nothing in the server is Claude-specific. To skip MCP, call the HTTP API that the same local server exposes.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to keep the app open?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The MCP server runs inside the main Soundbox process, so there is no separate daemon to start. If the app is running, the tools are available. If it is not, the tools return an actionable error; they do not start a second copy that would compete for the GPU.",

            Soundbox runs open-weight models locally and does not train its own. Each model's
            licence is shown before you download it. The output is yours, and the model's terms
            govern what you may do with it. <C>list_models</C> reports the same thing as{" "}
            <C>commercial_use</C>, so an agent can check before it generates.
