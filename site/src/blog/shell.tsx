/**
 * The frame a blog page is drawn in.
 *
 * Not `DocsShell`. That one is three columns because a docs reader arrives
 * from a search result knowing one heading's name and needs to see where it
 * sits in the whole; its left column is a table of contents for the entire
 * manual. A post has no such whole to sit inside — you arrive at it, you read
 * it, you leave — so the left column would be a list of other posts, which is
 * an index pretending to be navigation.
 *
 * What is worth sharing is the scroll-spy, and that moved to
 * `components/on-this-page.tsx` rather than being copied.
