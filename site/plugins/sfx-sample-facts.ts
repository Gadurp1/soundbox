/**
 * `virtual:sfx-sample-facts`: each catalogue sample's duration and file size,
 * read from `site/public/sfx/<category>/manifest.json` at build time.
 *
 * The manifests are fetched at runtime because their waveform peaks are too
 * big to bundle (see `useSampleManifest`). That left the prerendered sample
 * pages with no duration at all, since the fetch never runs during SSR. These
 * two numbers per sample are small enough to bundle, so they are, and the
 * server render and the hydrated page agree on them.
 *
 * Shape: `{ [category]: { [sample]: [durationS, sizeBytes] } }`.
