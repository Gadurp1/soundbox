/**
 * Serve a few named files from another directory as if they were in this
 * build's `publicDir`.
 *
 * The site's own `publicDir` is `site/public` — the marketing media that the
 * app never loads. A handful of files (today just `favicon.svg`) belong to both
 * builds; they stay in `app/public`, the app's `publicDir`, and this plugin
 * hands them to the site too: from the dev server as a middleware, and in the
 * build as emitted assets at the same root-relative path. One copy on disk, so
 * the two cannot drift.
 *
 * Only for small, shared, root-level files. Anything that is site-only belongs
 * in `site/public`.
