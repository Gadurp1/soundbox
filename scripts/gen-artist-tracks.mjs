#!/usr/bin/env node
// Renders one signature track per artist on the /music roster.
//
// Same shape as gen-music-tracks.mjs: POST /api/generate, poll the job, pull
// the WAV, encode it to MP3, write a manifest beside the
// files. Output lands next to the artist covers in site/public/music/artists/
// as <slug>.mp3, with manifest.json keyed by slug.
//
// Usage: node scripts/gen-artist-tracks.mjs [slug ...] [--new-only]
//
// The prompt for each track IS the artist's persona string plus a brief —
// that is the entire point of the roster: a persona is a house style held
// constant, and the signature track is the audible proof. The personas here
// must stay in sync with app/src/content/music/artists.ts.
//
// Vocal split mirrors the main track list: four acts whose persona names a
// voice render on ACE-Step with a short lyrics block; the other sixteen are
// instrumental on Stable Audio 3.0 Small Music, which has no vocal path.
