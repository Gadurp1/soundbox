/**
 * Copy the JSON data files into `dist/` after a build.
 *
 * `audiocpp.ts` reads its catalog and parameter tables with `readFileSync`
 * rather than importing them, so `tsc` never emits or refreshes them — it only
 * compiles the `.ts`. `catalogPath()` looks next to the built module first and
 * falls back to `src/`, and that fallback was doing the work: with nothing in
 * `dist/models/`, the built server read the real catalog out of `src/`.
 *
 * Which held right up until an old copy landed in `dist/models/` and stopped
 * the fallback from firing. From then on every build silently shipped whatever
 * catalog happened to be sitting there — in practice one from months earlier,
 * before models moved to audio.cpp's own flat package layout, so every model
 * installed under the new layout read as "Not installed" in the packaged app
 * while working fine under `npm run dev`.
 *
 * So the copy is a real build step now. `dist/` is either absent (fallback) or
 * current (this script), never stale.
