 * `POST /api/repaint` — the editor's Repaint tool, which sends a highlighted
 * range and nothing else.
 *
 * What is pinned here is everything the route refuses before it starts a
 * render, because that is the whole point of refusing it here: a bad window
 * has to fail on the click rather than minutes into a model load. The happy
 * path needs a repaint-capable model installed, which a test box does not
 * have, so the last test asserts the order instead — the window is checked
 * against the clip before the catalogue is consulted at all.
