/**
 * Splitting a clip that has been trimmed.
 *
 * The split point is seconds into the clip as it plays, and a trimmed clip
 * plays `duration_s` of its source from `trim_start_s`. Split used to cut the
 * source from 0 and leave the head's trim in place, so on a trimmed clip both
 * halves held audio from the wrong part of the take.
 *
 * The source here is a ramp — each sample's value is the time it sits at —
 * so reading a half's first and last samples says exactly which stretch of
 * the take it holds.
 *
 * Loudness normalisation is left at its default on purpose. The upload is
 * normalised like any import, which only rescales the ramp, so times are read
 * against the stored source's own slope. The halves must not be normalised
 * again: each would get its own gain and the level would jump at the cut.
