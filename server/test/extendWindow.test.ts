/**
 * The windowing arithmetic behind `SoundboxService.extendWindowed`.
 *
 * The service method itself needs a loaded model and a child process, so what
 * is pinned here is the part that decides how many passes to run and where the
 * seams land — the part that silently produces a clip of the wrong length if
 * it is wrong.
 *
 * The audio assertions stand in for the property the whole approach rests on:
 * a repaint past the end of its input returns that input unchanged, so the new
 * material can be spliced onto the source with no crossfade and no drift in
 * position.
