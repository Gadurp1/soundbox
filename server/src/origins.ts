/**
 * Which browser origins the server trusts.
 *
 * Two places ask: CORS (whether a cross-origin page may read our responses)
 * and the MCP endpoint (which refuses an untrusted Origin outright). Both use
 * this one rule so they can't drift apart.
 *
 * It used to be "any http://localhost:* or 127.0.0.1:* page", on the theory
 * that only local things can reach a local server. But plenty of local things
 * are not Soundbox — another app's dev server, a local web tool, anything a
 * browser extension opens on localhost — and that rule let every one of them
 * read the library and drive generation. The trusted set is now just:
 *
 *   - the server's own origin, i.e. an Origin naming the same host:port as
 *     the request's Host header. That is the built UI the server serves,
 *     including inside the desktop shell, whose webview is pointed straight
 *     at `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` (the Tauri splash page never calls the
 *     API). The Host header is itself checked against loopback in app.ts, so
 *     a rebinding page can't satisfy this by naming its own domain.
 *   - the Vite dev server: `npm run dev` serves the UI on 5174 (or `PORT`)
 *     and proxies `/api`, `/mcp` and `/files` here with `changeOrigin`, so
 *     those requests arrive with Host rewritten to ours but Origin still
 *     naming the dev server.
 *   - origins whose host is listed in SOUNDBOX_ALLOWED_HOSTS — the existing
 *     opt-in for serving beyond loopback, which is also where a UI hosted on
 *     that name would load from.
