/**
 * Starting points for the endpoint form.
 *
 * Each is a filled-in `AudioEndpoint` minus the parts that are the user's own
 * (id, name, key). The bodies follow each project's published API docs as of
 * October 2026. They are a starting point, not a contract — the model names in
 * particular are whatever the user's server happens to serve, which is why the
 * form shows the template rather than hiding it behind the preset.
 *
 * Only servers people run themselves get a preset. A hosted, billed API can
 * still be added by hand — the template takes any URL — but Soundbox does not
 * promote one with a one-click entry.
