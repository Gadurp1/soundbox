/**
 * A minimal image-generation client, in the two shapes worth supporting.
 *
 * Sibling of `llm/client.ts` and the same idea: the managed engine and
 * somebody's existing install differ only in how the base URL is obtained, so
 * there is one request path and two ways of picking a `baseUrl`. Unlike chat,
 * though, there is no single de-facto API — so the *shape* is a setting:
 *
 *   "a1111"  — POST /sdapi/v1/txt2img (Automatic1111, Forge, SD.Next, and
 *              stable-diffusion.cpp's own sd-server, which serves this path
 *              alongside the OpenAI one). Carries steps, cfg and size, which
 *              is why the managed engine uses it: a turbo checkpoint rendered
 *              at somebody else's default 20 steps / cfg 7.5 comes out as
 *              mush, and the OpenAI shape has nowhere to say otherwise.
 *   "openai"  — POST /v1/images/generations (OpenAI, LocalAI, most proxies).
 *              Size is the only knob it carries; the rest is the endpoint's
 *              business.
 *
 * Both return raw PNG bytes to the caller. Nothing here writes to disk.
