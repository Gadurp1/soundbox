/**
 * The manual, cut into pieces the assistant can be handed.
 *
 * Soundbox ships 150KB of documentation across a README and eleven files in
 * `docs/`. A small local model has perhaps 38k tokens of context, most of
 * which is already spent on the model catalogue and the open timeline, so
 * "put the docs in the prompt" is not on the table. It has to be asked a
 * question and given the handful of sections that answer it.
 *
 * The retrieval is deliberately dumb: split on headings, score by term
 * overlap, take the best few. No embeddings, no index to rebuild, no second
 * model to run. That is not a compromise here — the corpus is twelve
 * hand-written files with descriptive headings, the vocabulary of a question
 * ("licence", "MCP", "stems", "gated") is the vocabulary of the heading that
 * answers it, and a wrong section costs the reader a paragraph rather than a
 * wrong action. Reach for something cleverer when the docs stop being written
 * by people who name their headings after what is under them.
 *
 * Read once and cached: these files ship with the app and cannot change while
 * it runs. In dev they can, which is what `reload()` is for.
