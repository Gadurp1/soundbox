/**
 * The guide: a conversation that explains Soundbox and points you at it.
 *
 * This used to be the assistant that built a prompt with you and handed back
 * a request to run. It is not any more, and the split is the point. Doing
 * things is `studio.ts` — one planner per kind of change, each validating
 * every id it emits against a real timeline. Explaining things is here, and
 * it does no CRUD at all: it creates nothing, edits nothing, deletes nothing
 * and proposes no work. Two jobs that were fighting for one prompt.
 *
 * What it gained instead is the manual. Soundbox ships a README and eleven
 * files in `docs/`, and every question people actually asked the old
 * assistant — which model can I ship, what is a stem, how do I connect an
 * agent, where is the licence — is answered in there in prose someone wrote
 * on purpose. `docs.ts` finds the handful of sections a question matches and
 * this file hands them over, so the answer is quoted from the documentation
 * rather than remembered from pre-training.
 *
 * Two rules survive from before, and one is new:
 *
 * - **Grounded, not general.** It answers from the sections it was given and
 *   the model cards it was shown. Where the docs are silent it says so.
 * - **It never runs anything.** Now literally: there is no action in its
 *   vocabulary. The worst it can do is send you to the wrong page.
 * - **It knows where things are.** Every answer can carry links into the app,
 *   checked against the real route table below, because "that is on the\n *   Models page" is only half an answer when the other half is a click.
 *
 * Pure and side-effect-free so the prompt and the parsing are testable without
 * a model running — see `server/test/assistant.test.ts`.

 * here is a place the guide will not send anyone, which is the safe way for
 * this list to be wrong. `parseAssistantReply` drops any link that is not on
