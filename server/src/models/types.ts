/**
 * What `ModelManager` and `service.ts` require of a model, whatever runs it.
 *
 * Only the part the service actually uses, which is smaller than
 * `AudioCppModel` itself:
 *
 *   describe() / status()      what the Models page and pickers show
 *   loaded / load() / unload() readiness, and the residency dance
 *   generate() and friends     the four task methods, one per surface
 *
 * All four task methods are required even though no model does more than one
 * of them. Making them optional would push a `?.` or a cast onto every call
 * site in `service.ts`, to guard against a case that cannot happen: the
 * service has already refused on `info.task` by then. An implementation whose
 * task this isn't throws a sentence saying so, which is a better failure than
 * "generate is not a function" either way.
 *
 * `EditSpec` and `ProgressFn` are imported from the audio.cpp adapter rather
 * than redeclared here. They were defined there first and every caller already
 * names them from there; a type-only import is erased at build time, so this
 * costs no cycle, and one definition means the two adapters cannot drift into
 * subtly different progress contracts.
