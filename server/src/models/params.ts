/**
 * What each model family will actually listen to.
 *
 * Everything here comes from audio.cpp's own `webui/configs/model_params.json`,
 * vendored next to this file. That matters: the alternative is a table of our
 * own guesses, and we have already learned what those are worth. The upstream
 * file is checked against `src/models/<family>/*.cpp`, and it predicted every
 * result we measured by hand — Chatterbox's `exaggeration` and `temperature`
 * move the audio, and the flags it does *not* list (`--instruct`, `--emotion`,
 * `--speaking-rate`, `cfg_weight`) do nothing on that family.
 *
 * Two things are worth knowing before trusting a row:
 *
 *  - These are **request options**, not CLI flags. `--temperature 1.4` is
 *    ignored by the families that list `temperature`; `--request-option
 *    temperature=1.4` is not. audio.cpp accepts unknown keys silently, so a
 *    wrong name is invisible rather than an error.
 *  - A listed param can still look dead because of another one. VibeVoice
 *    lists `temperature`, but it samples greedily until `do_sample=true`, so
 *    temperature alone changes nothing. Hence `requires` below.
