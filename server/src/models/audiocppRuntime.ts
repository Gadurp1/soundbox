/**
 * Lifecycle of the managed `audiocpp_server` child process.
 *
 * Soundbox has always shipped this binary — it comes down in the same release
 * archive as `audiocpp_cli` — and never run it. That left Soundbox
 * reimplementing, in TypeScript, work the runtime already does natively:
 * resolving which Hugging Face files a package needs, fetching them, and
 * deciding whether a package on disk counts as installed. Two implementations
 * of one job, and they disagreed — weights installed by a standalone audio.cpp
 * were invisible to Soundbox and vice versa, because each looked for its own
 * bookkeeping.
 *
 * It now runs inference too. A one-shot `audiocpp_cli` reloaded the model on
 * every single generation: measured against Stable Audio Small, ~8.5s of a
 * ~8.8s invocation was process startup and model load, and the same request
 * against a resident model came back in ~190ms. The CLI path survives as the
 * fallback for an install whose binary has no management endpoints.
 *
 * The awkward corner is cancellation. audio.cpp exposes no per-request cancel,
 * so stopping a generation means killing the process running it — which takes
 * the resident model down with it and makes the next request pay the load
 * again. That trade is deliberate: cancelling is occasional, and the reload
 * was being paid every time.
 *
 * Modelled closely on `llm/runtime.ts`, which does the same dance for
 * llama-server. The differences are all in what makes this one *optional*:
 * the management endpoints are an opt-in build flag upstream
 * (`-DAUDIOCPP_BUILD_NATIVE_MODEL_MANAGER=ON`), and a user pointing
 * SOUNDBOX_AUDIOCPP_BIN at their own build may well have a binary without
 * them — or no `audiocpp_server` beside it at all. Every entry point here can
 * answer "not available", and the caller falls back to the legacy downloader.
