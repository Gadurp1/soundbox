/**
 * The checks every engine installer runs on a GitHub release before trusting
 * it. Shared by `audiocppBinary.ts`, `llamaServerBinary.ts` and
 * `sdServerBinary.ts`, which otherwise each own their asset matching.
 *
 * Three things are being guarded here, all of them reachable from an HTTP
 * request that only names a version:
 *
 *   - The version is spliced into a GitHub API path. A "version" of
 *     `../../other/repo/releases/latest` would look up — and install — a
 *     different project's release, so a tag has to look like a tag.
 *   - The release's `tag_name` becomes a directory under the install root, so
 *     the same rule applies to what GitHub sends back.
 *   - Each asset's download URL comes from that response too, and must point
 *     at this installer's own repository's release downloads, not anywhere a
 *     response could name.
 *
 * And then the bytes themselves: an archive with no checksum to compare
 * against is refused, not installed with a warning. A binary we run with the
 * user's privileges is the one download where "probably fine" isn't enough.
 * `SOUNDBOX_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_BINARIES=1` is the explicit way out for a release
 * that genuinely publishes no hashes.
