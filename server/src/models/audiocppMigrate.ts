/**
 * One-time move from Soundbox's old weights layout to audio.cpp's.
 *
 * Soundbox used to install packages under its own model id:
 *
 *     <root>/audiocpp-ace-step/ACE-Step1.5-GGUF/turbo/…gguf
 *
 * audio.cpp installs the same package one level higher, with the repo prefix
 * stripped rather than preserved:
 *
 *     <root>/ACE-Step1.5-GGUF/turbo/…gguf
 *
 * That extra level is why weights downloaded by one tool were invisible to the
 * other. Adopting upstream's layout fixes it, but only if what is already on
 * disk comes along — nobody should re-download tens of gigabytes because we
 * changed our minds about a directory name.
 *
 * This is a rename, not a copy: it moves the inner package directory up one
 * level and removes the emptied husk. It runs at startup, is idempotent, and
 * treats every failure as non-fatal — a models directory it cannot reorganise
 * is a reason to fall back to re-downloading one model, never a reason to stop
 * the server from starting.
