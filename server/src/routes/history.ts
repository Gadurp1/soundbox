/**
 * Conversation and history routes.
 *
 * A conversation is a durable thread with a URL you can come back to, and its
 * entries are what happened in it — see `history.ts` for why that is one list
 * rather than three.
 *
 * Appending is deliberately a route of its own rather than a side effect of
 * `/api/assistant/chat`. Plenty of what belongs in a studio's history never
 * goes near the assistant: a render started from the Prompt panel, an edit
 * applied from the chat that the studio planner handled locally. Those all
 * have to land in the same list, so the list takes writes from anyone.
