/**
 * Story routes.
 *
 * A story is a script that stays: ordered lines that each know where they read
 * in the script and where they sit in time. Sessions already group a run of
 * generations, but a session is a log — you don't rearrange one. A story is a
 * document, so it gets its own resource with its own child collection rather
 * than being expressed as a session with extra fields.
 *
 * Two things here are deliberately jobs rather than plain calls: speaking a
 * line and exporting the mixdown. Both take real time, and routing them
 * through the same queue as every other generation means the client shows
 * progress with the machinery it already has instead of a second convention
 * for "slow request".
