/**
 * `GET /api/fs/dirs` — directory listing, for the folder pickers in Settings.
 *
 * Nothing to do with the library; this is the "Browse…" affordance behind
 * paths like `sounds_dir`. It has to be a server route rather than anything in
 * the browser because the path the user picks is a path *the server* will
 * write to: a browser file input hands back a sandboxed name with no real
 * location, and on a Soundbox reached over the network the user's own disk is
 * the wrong disk entirely.
 *
 * Read-only and directory-names-only — no file names, no contents, no
 * creation. It sits behind the same loopback bind as every other route (see
 * `isAllowedOrigin`), so its reach is the same as the rest of the API's, which
 * already reads and writes the data directory and runs local processes.
