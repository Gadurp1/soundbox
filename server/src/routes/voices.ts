/**
 * Saved voices — the library the Voice studio picks from.
 *
 * A voice is either a reference clip to clone (`kind: "clone"`) or a name from
 * one model family's built-in list (`kind: "builtin"`); see `Voice` in
 * schemas.ts for why those can't be collapsed into one shape.
 *
 * Reference clips arrive as a raw WAV body rather than multipart/form-data:
 * one file with no other fields is the whole payload, so multipart would mean
 * a new dependency to parse an envelope carrying nothing. The clip's metadata
 * (name, notes, model_id) rides along as query parameters instead.
