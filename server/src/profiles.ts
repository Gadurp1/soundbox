/**
 * Named profiles — one Soundbox install, several separate libraries.
 *
 * A profile is a data directory: its own `soundbox.db`, `sounds/`, `artwork/`
 * and `settings.json`. Switching to another one is how you keep a curated
 * "demo" library apart from the scratch you generate while developing,
 * without a second checkout or a second `SOUNDBOX_DATA_DIR` to remember.
 *
 * Two things deliberately do *not* move with the profile:
 *
 *  - `models/` — the weights. Tens of gigabytes; a profile switch that
 *    re-downloaded them would make the feature unusable.
 *  - `bin/` — the audio.cpp / llama.cpp / stable-diffusion runtimes, same
 *    reason.
 *
 * Both live at the *install root* (`Paths.base`), and every profile shares
 * them. Only the library and the settings that describe it are per-profile.
 *
 * The default profile's directory **is** the install root, not a subdirectory
 * of it. That is what makes this backwards compatible: an existing
 * `~/.soundbox` written before profiles existed is the default profile,
 * found exactly where it already is, with no migration step.
