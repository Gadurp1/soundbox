/**
 * One failure taxonomy for everything that can go wrong on the way to a
 * sound: a generation, a model load, a download, a runtime that will not
 * start.
 *
 * `classify()` turns the text of an error into a stable topic, and
 * `buildFailure()` turns an error into the structured `Failure` the UI
 * renders as a card: a title that says what happened, a hint that says why,
 * what to do and what is kept, up to two fixes that link into the app, and
 * the raw text under Details. Rules are ordered most-specific first, and
 * each matches on the message rather than the exception type, because the
 * same cause reaches us as a `ModelError`, a `DownloadError`, a Node errno
 * or an audio.cpp stderr tail depending on where it surfaced.
 *
 * The hints are written for a person, with the wrong diagnosis ruled out
 * where it is common ("this is VRAM, not system RAM"), and never promise
 * more than the server knows.
