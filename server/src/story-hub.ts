/**
 * Who is doing what to a story, and telling everyone watching.
 *
 * A story is not a single-player document any more: an agent can be writing
 * lines over MCP while a person has the studio open on the same timeline. That
 * is fine — it is the point — but only if the studio can see it happening.
 * Otherwise the page silently drifts out of date, and the user edits a script
 * that no longer looks like what they are looking at.
 *
 * So two things are published here. `changed` says the story's contents moved
 * and anyone holding a copy should refetch. `agent` says a tool is mid-work,
 * which is what lets the studio say so and stop taking edits that would race
 * it. Both go out over the same per-story stream.
 *
 * Deliberately in-memory and not persisted: this is "what is happening right
 * now", which cannot survive a restart and should not pretend to. A process
 * that dies mid-agent-call leaves no work in flight to report.
