/**
 * What happened in a studio, in order, and who caused it.
 *
 * The History panel used to be the prompt box's own render log: a
 * `localStorage` array, one browser, one studio, and only the things that
 * panel generated. Everything else a person did — every question asked, every
 * edit the assistant applied, every line it wrote — left no trace at all.
 *
 * This is the other thing. Not the server log next door in Activity, which
 * answers "what is the backend doing" and is a rotating diagnostic tail with
 * levels and job ids; this answers "what did *I* do", survives a reload and a
 * different browser, and reads as a story rather than a trace. The two are
 * complementary and deliberately separate: an entry here can name the job
 * that carried it out, and the logs page is where you go when you want to
 * know why that job went wrong.
 *
 * An entry is one turn of cause and effect:
 *
 *   - what was said (`role`, `content`) — the conversation
 *   - what it did (`actions`) — the edits that were applied
 *   - what came of it (`sound_ids`) — the audio that now exists
 *
 * All three are optional because not every turn has all three. A question has
 * words and no effect. A render from the prompt panel has an effect and no
 * words. Keeping them in one table rather than three is the point: "what
 * happened here" is one list, in one order, or it is not history.
